AI Itinerary Crafter

AI Itinerary Crafter is a product-focused web application that helps travelers create deeply personalized itineraries by acting as a smart co-pilot for prompting large language models (LLMs). It explores user-centric AI design: how a guided, interactive UI can unlock the full potential of generative AI for complex, creative tasks like travel planning.

Product Vision — Your Personal Travel Curator

Generic AI chats can hand you a top-10 list. This app helps you shape a trip that feels handcrafted by a local who understands your style. The perfect trip isn’t only where you go—it’s the feeling you want to experience. Our job is to capture that feeling and turn it into a practical, actionable plan you can use.

User Problem — The “Blank Canvas” Wall

Most travelers struggle to get great output from AI because:

Prompt paralysis: A blank chat box leads to generic “Plan a trip to Paris” results.

Missing specifics: Budget, pace, interests, and “vibe” are rarely captured.

Unstructured output: Dense text isn’t a usable itinerary.

Poor real-world context: Typical answers ignore dates, holidays, and opening hours.

Our Approach — A Guided Conversation (Not a Blank Box)

We replace the single text box with a friendly, step-by-step journey:

Guided Inputs: Short, easy questions. Where are you going? When? Who’s with you? Daily budget?

Vibe Selectors: Core to the experience—pick descriptors and moods that define your trip.

Pace: Fast-paced & Action-packed ↔ Relaxed & Slow

Interests: Foodie Adventure, Art & History, Hidden Gems, Nightlife, Outdoor & Nature

Style: Luxury & Comfort, Budget-Friendly, Family Fun, Solo Explorer

Intelligent Prompt Construction: We stitch your choices into a high-quality prompt that sets the right context for the AI—without you doing any “prompt engineering.”

Structured, Actionable Output: Results are rendered as a clean day-by-day timeline with neighborhoods, movement time, and practical tips—not a wall of text.

Note: The app will send your structured inputs to an AI provider and then parse and present the response in a clear, visual format. Exact implementation details may evolve.

What You Get — From Clicks to a Curated Plan

A trip that reflects your mood and constraints, not a generic checklist.

A timeline you can read at a glance:

Day → Summary → Blocks (e.g., Morning market in Sant Antoni, Gothic Quarter walk, Tapas in El Born)

Each block includes a short description, optional neighborhood, estimated duration, and insider tips.

Effortless iteration: Change the vibe, pace, or budget and regenerate a refined plan.

Edit & share: Tweak details and share a link with friends or family.

Key Features & Design Philosophy

Guided UI over free-form chat: Reduce cognitive load with small, meaningful choices.

Vibe-first discovery: Inspire users with combinations (e.g., Slow & Foodie, Outdoors & Hidden Gems).

Explainability in plain language: The UI clarifies why a suggestion appears (e.g., budget fit, neighborhood clustering).

Mobile-first & accessible: Clear type, high contrast, keyboard-friendly flows, respectful motion.

Graceful fallbacks: If data is uncertain (e.g., seasonal closures), show alternatives or call it out.

Privacy-aware: Only collect what’s needed to generate your plan; keep control with the user.

FAQs

Why not just ask an AI directly?
Most travelers don’t know which details matter. The guided flow captures those details and translates them into a great prompt so you get a plan that actually fits you.

Will this be accurate to dates and opening hours?
We’ll encourage date-aware context and highlight uncertainties. The plan is a smart starting point—you remain in control.

Do I need to write prompts?
No. You make choices; the app does the prompting and formatting.

What about privacy?
We only collect the info needed to build your plan. You can edit or delete your plan at any time.
