AI Itinerary Crafter
AI Itinerary Crafter is a product-focused web application that helps travelers create deeply personalized itineraries by acting as a smart "co-pilot" for prompting Large Language Models (LLMs). This project is an exploration of user-centric AI design, focusing on how a guided and interactive UI can unlock the full potential of generative AI for complex, creative tasks like travel planning.

The Product Vision: Your Personal Travel Curator
Generic AI chats can give you a list of tourist spots. This app helps you build a trip that feels like it was handcrafted for you by a local expert who understands your unique style. We believe the perfect trip isn't just about where you go; it's about the feeling you want to experience. Our app is designed to capture that feeling and turn it into a practical, actionable plan.

The User Pain Point: The "Blank Canvas" Problem
Using a powerful AI for travel planning sounds great in theory, but most people face a significant hurdle:

Prompt Paralysis: Staring at a chat box, users don't know what to ask. "Plan a trip to Paris" yields a generic, boring list of the same top 10 attractions.

Lack of Specificity: Users don't realize they need to provide details about their budget, pace, interests, and "vibe" to get a truly personalized result.

Generic, Unusable Output: The AI's response is often a dense block of text that's hard to parse and isn't structured like a real, usable itinerary.

Missing Real-World Context: Standard AI responses don't account for real-time events, opening hours, or local holidays that could impact a trip.

Our Solution: A Guided Conversation, Not a Blank Box
This app solves the "blank canvas" problem by replacing a single chat box with a fun, interactive, and guided experience. We help you build the perfect prompt without you ever having to think about "prompt engineering."

Guided Input Form: Instead of one big question, we ask a series of small, easy ones. "Where are you going?" "When?" "Who are you traveling with?" "What's your daily budget?"

"Vibe" Selectors: This is the core of the experience. Users can select from a palette of descriptive tags to define their ideal trip, such as:

Pace: Fast-Paced & Action-Packed vs. Relaxed & Slow

Interests: Foodie Adventure, Art & History, Hidden Gems, Nightlife, Outdoor & Nature

Style: Luxury & Comfort, Budget-Friendly, Family Fun

Intelligent Prompt Construction: Behind the scenes, the app takes these structured inputs and masterfully weaves them into a detailed, highly specific prompt designed to get the best possible result from the AI.

Structured & Actionable Output: The AI's response is parsed and displayed not as a wall of text, but as a clean, day-by-day timeline with locations, descriptions, and insider tips.

Key Features & Design Philosophy
From Simple Clicks to a Masterpiece Prompt: The user's journey is effortless. They click buttons and select tags, and the app does the expert work of talking to the AI.

Real-Time Event Integration (Future Vision): The generated prompt will include a query for notable local events, festivals, or holidays happening during the user's selected travel dates, adding a layer of timely relevance.

Editable & Shareable Itineraries: The final plan isn't static. Users can edit, add notes, and share a link to their curated itinerary with fellow travelers.

A Focus on Discovery: The app is designed to help users discover new possibilities. By presenting interesting "vibe" combinations, it can inspire travel ideas users might not have considered on their own.
